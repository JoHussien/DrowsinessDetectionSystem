# DrowsinessDetectionSystem
This repo serves as the repository of the CSCE 4604Project – Practical Machine Learning (Deep Learning) taught at the American University in Cairo at Spring 2021 and performed by me Youssef Hussien and Abdallah Abdelnaby.

Abstract:

  Drowsiness detection is a safety technology that can prevent accidents
caused by drowsy -sleepy- drivers while driving. This project aims to build a
drowsiness detection system that will detect if a driver’s eyes are closed for a
few seconds. The system detects this state of drowsiness and shall alert the
driver whenever this happens. If the driver’s drowsiness can be predicted at the
initial stages, and the driver can be alerted, then the number of accidents can be
reduced. We built this system using deep learning techniques which best fit the
problem’s requirements. The data set we use is available online by Kaggle
platform and contains images of many people’s closed and open eyes and
includes images of people yawning versus non-yawning people. This dataset is
best suited for detecting whether a person is drowsy or not. The validation
accuracy of our system reached 95%, while the testing accuracy reached 95.15%.
The system can detect drowsiness in both well-lit environments and dark ones.
Additionally, our system is able to efficiently detect multiple persons at once and
detect the drowsiness state of the left-most person assuming this is the driving
side.
